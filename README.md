This project is completely experimental and is used only for resumes. In this project, we want a simple bank that we can only open an account with.
It shows the person's profile, balance, and loan list.
This project is fully responsive and high-performance.
The only problem we have here is that we don't have data and backend.
But in the not too distant future, backend and working with API will be ready.
The following are just some explanations about starting the project.

### `npm run sass`

To start sass styles
